# Version - V1.1

# Goals:
- To build a ML model that is able to predict the sentiment from twitter hashtags, posts and profiles

# Key Insights and Notes
- This model still under maintenance and might be incorrect for text in Portuguese
- I am trying to understand how it is classifying a different language from the training dataset 
- Can we translate the training dataset?
- The model will perform correctly using english text, try modifying the hashtags 
- Repeated tweets are affecting the performance, it will be removed on the next updates 
 

# Version Updates:
- API connections
- Classify by hashtags
- Sklearn implemented 
- Amazon reviews database
- Save the model 
- Statistics
- Added sentiment database
- Comparisons added 

# Future Implementations: 
- Plot Analytical charts 
- Create a list with market symbol and their sentiment
- Add time period analysis(select period option)
- Create sentiment dictionaries from web studies 
- Hyperparameters Optimization 
- Train and test with the Brazilian dataset
- Test with other ML models 
- Test with ensemble model
- Analyse use of prepositions 
- Create a Market Checker were it indicates the sentiment on the period and Prints the Chart Bullish or Bearish
